# PyLog Threat Analyser üêç  
### Intelligent Threat Detection from Apache Logs

---

## üß† Overview
**PyLog Threat Analyser** is a Python command-line utility that scans Apache access logs, identifies potentially malicious IPs, and enriches them using the [AbuseIPDB](https://www.abuseipdb.com/) reputation API.  
It‚Äôs designed to replicate the early stages of *threat triage* that a SOC (Security Operations Centre) analyst would perform ‚Äî transforming raw logs into actionable intelligence.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features
- **Log Parsing:** Reads Apache access logs, counts requests, and identifies HTTP error spikes (4xx/5xx).  
- **Threat Intelligence Enrichment:** Queries AbuseIPDB for IP reputation, country, and abuse confidence score.  
- **Persistent Caching:** Uses SQLite to store IP reputations, reducing API calls and improving runtime efficiency.  
- **Prioritised Reporting:** Sorts IPs by error volume or threat score for immediate visibility.  
- **Clean CLI Interface:** Built with `argparse`, supporting enrichment flags and CSV export.  
- **Security-Conscious Design:** `.env` file for API keys, safe parameterised SQL, and rate-limit handling.

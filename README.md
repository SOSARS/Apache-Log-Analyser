* **Threat Summarisation:** Aggregates total requests and error counts for each unique IP address.
* **Prioritised Reporting:** Automatically sorts the output to display the IP addresses with the highest error counts at the top.
* **Professional CLI:** Utilises `argparse` for a clean and user-friendly command-line interface.
* **Formatted Output:** Presents the final report in a clean, human-readable table using `beautifultable`.
